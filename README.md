# Finance-Operations-Reconciliation-Pipeline
“End-to-end reconciliation pipeline aligning operational and financial data, with automated matching, exception handling, and daily reporting.”

## Business Scenario

This project simulates a company where operational activity (orders and shipments) must reconcile to financial records (invoices and ledger postings). Differences can arise due to timing, partial fulfillment, refunds, or data issues. The goal is to automatically match records, identify true exceptions, and provide clear outputs for finance and operations teams.
